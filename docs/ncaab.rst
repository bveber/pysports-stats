NCAAB Package
=============

The NCAAB package offers multiple modules which can be used to retrieve
information and statistics for Men's Division I College Basketball, such as team
names, season stats, game schedules, and boxscore metrics.

Boxscore
--------

The Boxscore module can be used to grab information from a specific game.
Metrics range from number of points scored to the number of blocked shots, to
the assist percentage and much more. The Boxscore can be easily queried by
passing a boxscore's URI on sports-reference.com which can be retrieved from the
``Schedule`` class (see ``Schedule`` module below for more information on
retrieving game-specific information).

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscore

    game_data = Boxscore('2018-04-02-21-villanova')
    print(game_data.home_points)  # Prints 79
    print(game_data.away_points)  # Prints 62
    df = game_data.dataframe  # Returns a Pandas DataFrame of game metrics

The Boxscore module also contains a ``Boxscores`` class which searches for all
games played on a particular day and returns a dictionary of matchups between
all teams on the requested day. The dictionary includes the names and
abbreviations for each matchup as well as the boxscore link if applicable.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from sports.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscores

    games_today = Boxscores(datetime.today())
    print(games_today.games)  # Prints a dictionary of all matchups for today
    games_today.dataframe # Returns a Pandas DataFrame of simple boxscore details for every game

The ``Boxscores`` class also allows the ability to query over a range of dates
using a second optional parameter during instantiation of the class. To query a
range of dates, enter the start date as the first parameter and the inclusive
end date as the second parameter.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from sports.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscores

    # Pulls all games between and including November 11, 2017 and November 12,
    # 2017
    games = Boxscores(datetime(2017, 11, 11), datetime(2017, 11, 12))
    # Prints a dictionary of all results from November 11, 2017 and November 12,
    # 2017
    print(games.games)

Conferences
-----------

The Conference module allows conferences to be pulled for any season using the
``Conferences`` class. Accessing the class properties exposes various
dictionaries containing the team and conference abbreviations as well as other
information. To get a list of conference abbreviations for each team, query the
``team_conference`` property.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.conferences import Conferences

    conferences = Conferences()
    # Prints a dictionary of the team abbrevation as a key and conference
    # abbreviation as the value.
    print(conferences.team_conference)

The ``conferences`` property can also be queried to provide more details on the
teams in every conference.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.conferences import Conferences

    conferences = Conferences()
    # Prints a dictionary where each key is the conference abbreviation and
    # each value is a dictionary containing the full conference name as well as
    # another dictionary of all teams in the conference, including name and
    # abbreviation for each team.
    print(conferences.conferences)

.. automodule:: sports.ncaab.conferences
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Player
------

The Player module contains an abstract base class that can be inherited by both
the ``BoxscorePlayer`` and ``Player`` classes in the ``Boxscore`` and ``Roster``
modules, respectively. All of the properties that appear in the
``AbstractPlayer`` class can be read from either of the two child classes
mentioned above.

.. automodule:: sports.ncaab.player
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Rankings
--------

The Rankings module includes the ``Rankings`` class which can be used to easily
query the NCAAB Men's Division-I Basketball rankings published by the Associated
Press on a week-by-week basis. Different formats can be referenced, ranging from
a lightweight dictionary of the most recent rankings containing only the team
abbreviation and rank, to a much larger dictionary of all rankings for an entire
season with results including full team name and abbreviation, current rank,
week number, previous rank, and movement.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.rankings import Rankings

    rankings = Rankings()
    # Prints a dictionary of just the team abbreviation and rank for the current
    # week
    print(rankings.current)
    # Prints more detailed information including previous rank, full name, and
    # movement for all teams in current week
    print(rankings.current_extended)
    # Prints detailed information for all teams for all weeks where rankings
    # have been published for the requested season.
    print(rankings.complete)

.. automodule:: sports.ncaab.rankings

    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Roster
------

The Roster module contains detailed player information, allowing each player to
be queried by their player ID using the ``Player`` class which has detailed
information ranging from career points totals to single-season stats and player
height and weight. The following is an example on collecting career information
for Carsen Edwards.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.roster import Player

    carsen_edwards = Player('carsen-edwards-1')
    print(carsen_edwards.name)  # Prints 'Carsen Edwards'
    print(carsen_edwards.points)  # Prints Edwards' career points total
    # Prints a Pandas DataFrame of all relevant stats per season for Edwards
    print(carsen_edwards.dataframe)

By default, the player's career stats are returns whenever a property is called.
To get stats for a specific season, call the class instance with the season
string. All future property requests will return the season-specific stats.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.roster import Player

    carsen_edwards = Player('carsen-edwards-1')  # Currently pulling career stats
    print(carsen_edwards.points)  # Prints Edwards' CAREER points total
    # Prints Edwards' points total only for the 2017-18 season.
    print(carsen_edwards('2017-18').points)
    # Prints the number of games Edwards played in the 2017-18 season.
    print(carsen_edwards.games_played)

After requesting single-season stats, the career stats can be requested again
by calling the class without arguments or with the 'Career' string passed.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.roster import Player

    carsen_edwards = Player('carsen-edwards-1')  # Currently pulling career stats
    # Prints Edwards' points total only for the 2017-18 season.
    print(carsen_edwards('2017-18').points)
    print(carsen_edwards('Career').points)  # Prints Edwards' career points total

In addition, the Roster module also contains the ``Roster`` class which can be
used to pull all players on a team's roster during a given season and creates
instances of the Player class for each team member and adds them to a list to be
easily queried.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.roster import Roster

    purdue = Roster('PURDUE')
    for player in purdue.players:
        # Prints the name of all players who played for Purdue in the most
        # recent season.
        print(player.name)

.. automodule:: sports.ncaab.roster
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Schedule
--------

The Schedule module can be used to iterate over all games in a team's schedule
to get game information such as the date, score, result, and more. Each game
also has a link to the ``Boxscore`` class which has much more detailed
information on the game metrics.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.schedule import Schedule

    purdue_schedule = Schedule('PURDUE')
    for game in purdue_schedule:
        print(game.date)  # Prints the date the game was played
        print(game.result)  # Prints whether the team won or lost
        # Creates an instance of the Boxscore class for the game.
        boxscore = game.boxscore

.. automodule:: sports.ncaab.schedule
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Teams
-----

The Teams module exposes information for all NCAAB teams including the team name
and abbreviation, the number of games they won during the season, the total
number of shots they've blocked, and much more.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.teams import Teams

    teams = Teams()
    for team in teams:
        print(team.name)  # Prints the team's name
        print(team.blocks)  # Prints the number of shots the team blocked

A team can also be requested directly by calling the ``Team`` class which
returns a Team instance identical to the one in each element in the loop above.
To request a specific team, use the team's abbreviation while calling the Team
class.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.teams import Team

    purdue = Team('PURDUE')

Each Team instance contains a link to the ``Schedule`` class which enables easy
iteration over all games for a particular team. A Pandas DataFrame can also be
queried to easily grab all stats for all games.

.. code-block:: python

    from sports.ncaab.teams import Teams

    teams = Teams()
    for team in teams:
        schedule = team.schedule  # Returns a Schedule instance for each team
        # Returns a Pandas DataFrame of all metrics for all game Boxscores for
        # a season.
        df = team.schedule.dataframe_extended

Each Team instance also contains a link to the ``Roster`` class which
enables players from the team to be easily queried. Each Roster instance
contains detailed stats and information for each player on the team.

Extra Considerations:

Data is unavailable prior to the 1992-1993 season and opponent data is unavailable
prior to the 2009-2010 season.

Occassionaly a Division-I team plays against a small school without any available data.
In order to remove teams without a valid team page, the team name is validated against
a list of teams who belong to valid Division-I coferences. By default, the team names are
validated against a constant list in ncaab/constants.py and the plan is to create a new
release whenever that list changes, however if you notice an issue with missing teams you can
use the parameter ``recompute_conferences`` to dynamically generate the list with the most
up to date information. However, this will require several requests to the source page
resulting in slower than normal performance.
